		<h2 class="text-center"> Why should we analyze the video game industry?</h2>
		<p class="intro">
			This project explores the video game industry by analyzing various datasets related to game sales, genres
			and platforms. We aim to uncover trends and insights into how different genres have evolved over time and
			the impact of publishers on the gaming market. Through interactive visualizations, we will tell the story of
			video game popularity and sales distribution across different platforms.
			By examining historical data, we can identify patterns in consumer preferences, the rise and fall of
			specific genres, and the influence of major publishers. This analysis not only highlights the dynamics of
			the gaming industry but also provides valuable insights for developers and marketers looking to understand
			market trends and consumer behavior.

			We can see that Nintendo focused on platform and puzzle genres as seen in the heatmap, which is a
			family-friendly genre, and parents are also not hesitant in buying these games for their kids. Similarly,
			Electronic Arts mainly focused on the sports genre, which helped them increase their sales because sports
			lovers
			would play sports games such as Cricket07, FIFA, etc.
			Moreover, the analysis reveals that consoles like PlayStation and Xbox have diversified their game
			offerings,
			catering to a broader audience by including various genres such as action, adventure, and role-playing
			games.
			This strategic approach has allowed them to maintain a competitive edge in the market, appealing to both
			casual
			and hardcore gamers alike. Hence, it can be said that sticking to certain types of game genres for a long
			time
			can help the publisher acquire a top position in the gaming industry.
