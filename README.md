This project explores the video game industry by analyzing various datasets related to game sales, genres, and platforms. We aim to uncover trends and insights into how different genres have evolved over time and the impact of publishers on the gaming market. Through interactive visualizations, we will tell the story of video game popularity and sales distribution across different platforms. 
By examining historical data, we can identify patterns in consumer preferences, the rise and fall of specific genres, and the influence of major publishers. This analysis not only highlights the dynamics of the gaming industry but also provides valuable insights for developers and marketers looking to understand market trends and consumer behavior.
